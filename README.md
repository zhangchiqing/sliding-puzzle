> node index.js 3
level: 3
use keyboard to start: up, down, left, right
 5   8  -1
 4   1   2
 6   7   3
```

The above command will generate a `3 x 3` sliding puzzle. Then you can use the arrows keys 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right' to solve it.

You can also get `3 x 4` puzzle like this:
```
> node index.js 3 4
level: 3
use keyboard to start: up, down, left, right
10   8   3  11
-1   7   9   5
 4   1   6   2
```

Have fun :)
